                <p class="hello">Pubergaon Polytechnic and Medical Institute (PPMI) is one of the best and biggest private polytechnic 
                    and Medical Institute in Bangladesh. It was established in 2011 with only 3(three) departments of diploma in 
                    engineering in Electrical, Civil, and Computer technology with growing demands of mid-level technical 
                    manpower at home and abroad the institute has since greatly expanded.</p>

                <h3>Diploma In Textile</h3>
                <p class="hellob">The largest employment sector in Bangladesh is the textile industry. Every year, thousands of skilled textile engineers 
                    are needed in this sector. However, the supply of skilled textile diploma engineers falls short of the demand. Currently, 
                the country has 445 spinning factories, 796 fabric manufacturing factories, 240 dyeing, printing, and finishing factories, and over 5,500 garment factories. 
        The primary goal of this course is to develop skilled textile engineers to sustain the country's largest export-oriented industrial sector.</p>
